Description:
This project contains the neccesary parts to turn your drone into something similar to a lotus flower. 

NOTE: the project requires the drone to be flying upside down such that the LED deck is facing up. See the following forum post for thr for the firmware changes (https://forum.bitcraze.io/viewtopic.php?p=16649#p16649)

The parts were printed in PLA on an ultimaker 3. 
The main shroud can be printed with bery minimal supports. 

The arms need to printed with PVA support material then placed in a big jar of water to be dissolved. Dissolving is faster if the water is change regularly, is agitated and is warm. I used a magnetic stirrer with the heat on low to get the PVA out of the tiny nooks in about 4 hours.
