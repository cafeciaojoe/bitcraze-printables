## Reccomendations
- The parts were printed in tough PLA on an ultimaker 3. 
- Print many spares, these tings are tricky to assemble
- 0.8mm carbon rod was used for the prop guards. (https://www.hyperflight.co.uk/products.asp?code=CARBON-ROD-08MM)
- .5mm carbon rod breaks too easily and 1mm carbon rod is too strong and splits open the model
- The arms need to printed with PVA support material then placed in a big jar of water to be dissolved. Dissolving is faster if the water is change regularly, is agitated and is warm. I used a magnetic stirrer with the heat on low to get the PVA out of the tiny nooks in about 4 hours. 

NOTE: the project requires the drone to be flying upside down such that the LED deck is facing up. See the following forum post for thr for the firmware changes (https://forum.bitcraze.io/viewtopic.php?p=16649#p16649)
